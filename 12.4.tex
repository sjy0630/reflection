\maketitle
it's my first time to use LaTeX for writing reflections. I'm excited to see how it can help me organize my thoughts and present them in a clear and professional manner.\par
it's been a little bewildering week.i.e. I don't have a clear schedule recently,but I do have tests coming up soon.I need to manage my time better to ensure I can prepare adequately for my exams while also keeping up with my other responsibilities.\par


wow, I have to say copilot is powerful when writing.But with the assistance,my command of english is gradually falling behind,which makes me a little worried about the CET4 in 2 weeks.
i genuinely hope using english to write reflections can help me improve my language skills while also allowing me to express my thoughts more effectively.\par
Overall, I'm looking forward to this new experience and hope that it will help me grow both academically and personally.

Alongside linear algebra, calculus, and programming, I have to spare some time to learn math modeling and review the Utilitarianism recently. I hope I can balance all these subjects well and make the most of my time in school.\par
Thank you for reading my reflections! (it reads robot-like)
